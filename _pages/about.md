Greetings! My name is Lingqi Su (苏灵奇, pronounced as Lynn-Chee Su). I am an experienced engineer and researcher for HVAC and energy system. I am currently working at ENGIE Lab China and I got my Dr.-Ing. (Doctor of Engineering) from Friedrich Schiller University Jena in Germany.

My major research interests include machine learning and optimization assisted energy system design and operation, electricity market prediction and trading, thermo-active building systems. 

At my leisure time, I enjoyed listening to pop music, playing my cello, watching movies, watching Borussia Dortmund's footbal games and practising Thai-boxing together with my wife.
