Greetings! My name is Lingqi Su | 苏灵奇 (pronounced as Lynn-Chee Su). I am an Assistant Professor at Sino-German College of Applied Sciences, Tongji University. Prior to joining in Tongji University, I worked for ENGIE China and Trina Power. I received my Dr.-Ing. (Doctor of Engineering) from Friedrich Schiller University Jena in Germany.

My major research interests include machine learning and optimization assisted energy system design and operation, power market algorithmic trading, thermo-active building systems. 

At my leisure time, I enjoyed listening to pop music, playing my cello, watching movies, watching Borussia Dortmund's footbal games and practising Thai-boxing together with my wife.
