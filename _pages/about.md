Greetings! My name is Lingqi Su (苏灵奇, pronounced as Lynn-Chee Su). I am an experienced engineer and researcher for HVAC and energy system. I am currently working at ENGIE Lab China and I got my Dr.-Ing. from Friedrich Schiller University Jena in Germany. 

My major research interests include machine learning and optimization assisted energy system design and operation, electricity market prediction and trading, thermo-active building systems. 

At my leisure time, I enjoyed listening to pop music, playing my cello, watching Borussia Dortmund's footbal games and practising Thai-boxing with my wife.

Here is my [curriculum vitae](/files/cv_l_su_20221114.pdf), if you want to learn more about me.
