建筑围护结构作为室内外的环境缓冲层,是影响建筑室内热舒适度和建筑能耗的重要因素和关键部件.本文通过整合保温隔热技术与光伏发电技术,设计并尝试搭建了 1种新型有源动态复合围护结构,对该围护结构在冬季工况下的热工性能进行了测试研究,测试结果表明:该围护结构在阴天和晴天工况下内壁面温度较相应不通热水上升0.7℃和3℃左右,阴天条件下建筑散热可减少50％,晴天条件下建筑得热能增加3.5～6.7倍,旨在探索1种整合光伏发电系统和改善玻璃幕墙热工性能的办公等公共建筑围护结构,促进实现大面积使用幕墙结构建筑的近零能耗目标.

Building envelope, as the buffer layer between indoor and outdoor environment, is an important factor and key component affecting indoor thermal comfort and building energy consumption. In this paper, we designed and built a novel active dynamic composite building envelope by integrating insulation and photovoltaic technologies. We conducted thermal performance tests on the building envelope under winter conditions. The test results show that the indoor surface temperature of the building envelope increases by about 0.7°C and 3°C under cloudy and sunny conditions, respectively, compared to the case without hot water circulation. Under cloudy conditions, the building heat loss can be reduced by 50%, and the building heat gain can be increased by 3.5 to 6.7 times under sunny conditions. The purpose of this study is to explore a building envelope for office buildings and other public buildings that integrates photovoltaic power generation systems and improves the thermal performance of glass curtain walls, and to promote the realization of the goal of near-zero energy consumption for buildings with a large area of curtain wall structures.
